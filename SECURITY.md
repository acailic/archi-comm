# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep ArchiComm and its users safe. We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the latest stable release line.

- 0.2.x — fully supported
- < 0.2.0 — no longer maintained

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities through GitHub Security Advisories:

- New advisory (private): https://github.com/acailic/archicomm/security/advisories/new

If you cannot use the advisory workflow, contact the maintainers using the contact method referenced in this repository’s `SECURITY.md` and/or `package.json` metadata. Avoid filing public issues for sensitive reports.

When reporting, include:

- A detailed description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
- Affected version(s) and environment details
- Any suggested mitigations

## Our Process and Timelines

- Acknowledgement: within 48 hours
- Triage and validation: typically within 5 business days
- Fix development and coordination: as quickly as possible, prioritizing severity
- Public disclosure: coordinated with you once a fix or mitigation is available

We may request additional information. Credit will be given to reporters who follow responsible disclosure, unless anonymity is requested.

## Safe Harbor

We support good-faith security research. When you follow this policy:

- We will not initiate legal action for accidental violations
- We consider testing that respects user privacy and does not degrade services to be in scope
- Out-of-scope testing includes denial of service, social engineering, and physical attacks

Thank you for helping improve the security of ArchiComm.
