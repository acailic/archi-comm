## Testing Philosophy

ArchiComm's E2E testing strategy focuses on **user-centric quality assurance** that ensures our architecture communication platform works reliably across all supported environments and use cases.

### Core Principles

1. **User Journey Focus** - Tests mirror real user workflows and scenarios
2. **Cross-Platform Reliability** - Consistent behavior across web and desktop environments
3. **Performance Awareness** - Quality includes performance and responsiveness
4. **Visual Consistency** - UI regression prevention through automated visual testing
5. **Accessibility First** - Inclusive design validation through automated a11y testing
