## Multi-Session Testing Strategy

### Session Persistence Testing

Multi-session testing validates that user workflows function correctly across multiple browser sessions, days, and collaboration scenarios.

#### Test Categories

1. **Multi-Day Sessions** - Design state preservation across browser restarts and time gaps
2. **Collaboration** - Multi-user editing scenarios and conflict resolution
3. **Error Recovery** - Graceful degradation and recovery from various failure modes
4. **Cross-Platform** - Consistent behavior across browsers and devices

#### Session State Management

- **Storage Location**: `e2e/session-states/` directory
- **State Files**: Playwright storageState JSON files for test scenarios
- **Baseline States**: Pre-created states for common test scenarios
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup after test runs

#### Multi-Day Session Tests

Tests design state preservation across extended time periods:

- **Day 1 Tests**: Create complex designs with auto-save verification
- **Day 2+ Tests**: Restore designs from previous sessions using storageState
- **Long-term Persistence**: Test design restoration after simulated week gaps
- **Edge Cases**: Corrupted session recovery, storage quota exceeded

#### Collaboration Tests

Tests multi-user editing scenarios:

- **Basic Collaboration**: Share design link generation and peer access
- **Conflict Resolution**: Concurrent component addition, annotation conflicts
- **Real-time Sync**: Peer sees owner changes instantly
- **Merge Strategies**: User choice between "keep mine", "keep theirs", "merge both"

#### Error Recovery Tests

Tests application resilience under failure conditions:

- **Rendering Errors**: Canvas rendering failure recovery
- **Network Errors**: Offline mode graceful degradation
- **Data Corruption**: localStorage corruption recovery
- **Performance Issues**: Memory pressure and cleanup

#### Cross-Platform Tests

Tests consistent behavior across browsers and devices:

- **Browser Consistency**: Identical rendering across Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Mobile vs Desktop**: Design state preservation across viewport changes
- **Performance Parity**: Consistent performance across platforms
- **Feature Parity**: Auto-save, undo/redo, annotation editing consistency

### Test Data Management Guidelines

#### Storage State Files

Located in `e2e/session-states/` directory:

- `day1-simple-design.json` - Basic design after day 1
- `day1-complex-design.json` - Complex multi-component design
- `collaboration-owner.json` - Design owner state
- `collaboration-peer.json` - Collaborating user state
- `error-recovery-baseline.json` - Clean state before triggering errors

#### Test Sequencing

- Use `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' })` for sequential tests
- Multi-day tests must run in order to maintain session continuity
- Storage state files enable resuming from specific application states

#### Environment Variables

- `MULTI_SESSION_TESTS=true` - Enable/disable long-running tests
- `COLLABORATION_TESTS=true` - Enable tests requiring multiple browser contexts

### Cross-Platform Testing Guidelines

#### Browser Project Configuration

Tests run across multiple Playwright projects automatically:

```typescript
projects: [
  { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
  { name: 'firefox', use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] } },
  { name: 'webkit', use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] } },
  { name: 'mobile-chrome', use: { ...devices['Pixel 5'] } },
  { name: 'mobile-safari', use: { ...devices['iPhone 12'] } }
]
```

#### Viewport Testing Strategy

- **Desktop**: 1920x1080 (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Tablet**: 768x1024 (Chrome mobile emulation)
- **Mobile**: 375x667 (Chrome mobile emulation)

#### Performance Benchmarking

Cross-platform validation includes performance consistency:

- Canvas performance across browsers (component addition timing)
- Memory usage consistency (heap size monitoring)
- Rendering performance parity (frame rate measurement)

### Debugging Guidelines

#### Multi-Session Test Failures

- Inspect storageState files in `e2e/session-states/` for corruption
- Verify session metadata exists in localStorage
- Check auto-save functionality with network monitoring
- Use `test.step()` for granular failure isolation

#### Collaboration Test Failures

- Monitor synthetic conflict events in browser console
- Verify share URL generation and peer context creation
- Check conflict resolution UI elements with `data-testid` selectors
- Use browser context isolation for peer simulation

#### Error Recovery Test Failures

- Enable `debugHelpers.logPageConsole()` for error capture
- Monitor recovery overlay visibility with `data-testid="recovery-overlay"`
- Verify error boundary functionality with React DevTools
- Test memory pressure simulation with `performance.memory` API

#### Cross-Platform Test Failures

- Compare baseline data across browser projects
- Use screenshot comparison for visual regression detection
- Monitor performance metrics for consistency validation
- Verify component positions with bounding box tolerance

### Test Execution Guidelines

#### Running Specific Test Suites

```bash
# Multi-session tests only
npx playwright test --project=multi-session

# Collaboration tests
npx playwright test --project=collaboration

# Cross-platform consistency
npx playwright test --grep="cross-platform"

# All new test categories
npx playwright test multi-day-session.spec.ts collaboration-conflict.spec.ts error-recovery.spec.ts cross-platform-consistency.spec.ts
```

#### Environment Configuration

```bash
# Enable multi-session tests
MULTI_SESSION_TESTS=true npx playwright test

# Enable collaboration tests
COLLABORATION_TESTS=true npx playwright test

# Run with visual comparisons
npx playwright test --project=scenario-visual
```

#### CI/CD Integration

Multi-session tests require special consideration in CI/CD:

- **Sequential Execution**: Use `workers: 1` for multi-session tests
- **Longer Timeouts**: Increase timeout for browser restart scenarios
- **Storage Cleanup**: Ensure session state cleanup between CI runs
- **Retry Logic**: Reduce retries for sequential tests to avoid flakiness

### Test Naming Conventions

#### Multi-Session Tests

- `day X: [action]` - Sequential tests spanning multiple days
- `[feature] recovery` - Error recovery scenarios
- `cross-browser [feature]` - Cross-platform consistency tests

#### Collaboration Tests

- `share [feature]` - Design sharing functionality
- `conflict [scenario]` - Conflict resolution scenarios
- `peer [action]` - Multi-user collaboration features

#### Test Organization

- **Test Groups**: Use `test.describe()` for logical grouping
- **Test Tags**: Use test names for filtering (e.g., `@multi-session`)
- **File Naming**: `[category]-[feature].spec.ts` pattern
- **Result Organization**: Separate directories for each test category

## Template Testing Strategy

### Template Categories

- Industry Templates: E-commerce, Fintech, Healthcare, Gaming — realistic workflows and domain validation
- Scalability Templates: Microservices (50+), Serverless, Distributed CQRS, High Availability — performance and scale validation
- Legacy Integration: Mainframe Bridge, FTP Integration, Database Modernization, Strangler Fig, Hybrid, Legacy Monitoring — integration and migration validation
- Performance Benchmarks: 100, 250, 500 component templates — stress and performance measurement

### Validation Approach

- Integrity checks: All component types must exist in ComponentPalette
- Metadata completeness: Name, category, component/connectivity counts, tags
- Render safety: All templates apply to canvas without errors
- Performance targets: < 10s for 100 components, < 30s for 500 components; virtualization verified on large graphs

### Fixture Management and E2E Integration

- Centralized fixtures via TestDataManager with categories: industry, scalability, legacy, benchmark
- Programmatic generation for large templates (100–500 components)
- E2E utilities: TestUtils.waitForStableCanvas(), TestUtils.measureOperationTime()
- Palette interaction using data-testid selectors: `palette-item-${type}`

### Execution Guides

- Template validation suite: `npm run test:e2e -- template-validation.spec.ts`
- Industry workflows: `npm run test:e2e -- industry-specific-tests.spec.ts`
- Scalability and benchmarks: `npm run test:e2e -- scalability-patterns.spec.ts --grep @stress`
- Legacy integration: `npm run test:e2e -- legacy-integration.spec.ts`

### Template Development Guidelines

- Use existing component types from ComponentPalette; validate via integrity checks
- Positioning strategies: grid (benchmarks), layered (industry), workflow-based (legacy)
- Connections reflect real data/API/event flows; info cards document domain nuances
- Metadata: complexity, estimatedTime, componentCount, connectionCount, tags, description

### Performance Testing Guidelines

- Targets: < 10s (100 components), < 30s (500 components)
- Validate virtualization on large templates; observe memory footprint via Performance APIs
- Capture screenshots for visual baselines of complex layouts
- Track regressions by comparing operation timings over time

### Maintenance and CI

- Version and tag templates; update metadata on changes
- Validate integrity in CI; include @stress group as optional matrix
- Deprecate templates with clear migration guidance
- Share templates for demos and video scenarios; ensure multi-session compatibility
