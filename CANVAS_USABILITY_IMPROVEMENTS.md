# Canvas Usability Improvements

## Purpose

This document outlines comprehensive usability enhancements for the ArchiComm canvas system. These features focus on improving productivity, workflow efficiency, and user experience when working with complex system architecture diagrams.

## Overview

The ArchiComm canvas system is feature-rich but was missing several key usability enhancements that would significantly improve the user experience. This implementation adds essential operations, workflow enhancements, and advanced features to make the canvas more productive and easier to use.

### User Benefits

- **Faster component creation**: Quick duplication and template library
- **Easier organization**: Grouping, alignment, and bulk operations
- **Better navigation**: Search, zoom to selection, and smart guides
- **Reduced errors**: Component locking and visual feedback
- **Improved workflows**: Keyboard shortcuts and context menus

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Essential Operations** (Implemented)

- Component duplication (Ctrl/Cmd+D)
- Multi-select with bulk operations
- Alignment tools (align left/right/top/bottom/center, distribute)
- Component search/filter in palette

**Phase 2: Workflow Enhancements** (Implemented)

- Component grouping/ungrouping
- Smart alignment guides (visual snap feedback)
- Zoom to selection/fit selected (shortcut in place; viewport fit pending)
- Enhanced context menu with quick actions
- Component locking/unlocking

**Phase 3: Advanced Features** (Future)

- Component templates library with categories
- Auto-arrange by type/layer
- Connection templates
- Keyboard shortcuts panel improvements
- Component notes/inline documentation

// Or use drag selection box
// User drags from (0,0) to (200,200)
canvasActions.setSelectionBox({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 200 });

const selectedIds = useSelectedComponentIds();
canvasActions.duplicateComponents(selectedIds, { x: 30, y: 30 });
```

### Component Grouping

const group = canvasActions.groupComponents(
  ["comp-1", "comp-2"],
  "Server Group",
);

// Ungroup later
canvasActions.ungroupComponents(group.id);
```

### Search and Filter

```typescript
// Search components
canvasActions.setComponentSearchQuery("server");

// Filter by category
canvasActions.setComponentFilterCategory("database");

## Migration Guide

### Backward Compatibility

All new features are **completely additive** and do not break existing functionality:

- Existing canvas modes remain unchanged
- Current component structure is preserved
- All existing keyboard shortcuts continue to work
- No changes to existing APIs or data formats

### New Optional Properties

New optional properties added to `DesignComponent`:

- `groupId?: string` - Reference to parent group
- `locked?: boolean` - Prevents accidental moves
- `notes?: string` - Inline documentation
- `tags?: string[]` - For search/filter

### State Migration

Store automatically initializes new state properties with sensible defaults:

- `selectedComponentIds: []`
- `componentGroups: []`
- `alignmentGuides: []`
- `lockedComponentIds: new Set()`

### Feature Adoption

Users can adopt new features gradually:

1. Multi-select works immediately with Shift+Click
2. Alignment toolbar appears when components selected
3. Search functionality available in component palette
4. Keyboard shortcuts provide quick access to all features

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented

- Memoized component selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient collision detection for selection box
- Debounced search to reduce computation
- Lazy loading of alignment guides
- Viewport-aware rendering for overlays

### Memory Usage

- Component groups store only IDs, not full component data
- Alignment guides auto-cleanup after display timeout
- Search indexing uses efficient string matching
- Selection state uses Set for O(1) lookup

### Rendering Performance

- Selection box renders only when dragging
- Group overlays only render when groups exist
- Alignment guides use CSS transforms for smooth animation
- Toolbar components conditionally render based on selection

This implementation provides a solid foundation for productive canvas workflows while maintaining the existing ArchiComm architecture and design patterns.
