## Technical Architecture Decisions

### React Flow vs. WebGL

**Decision**: Continue with React Flow + Virtualization
**Reasoning**:
- React Flow 12.8.4 supports virtualization (`onlyRenderVisibleElements`) for 60 FPS with 1000+ nodes
- Existing codebase deeply integrated with React Flow (CustomNode, CustomEdge, hooks)
- WebGL migration would require 4-6 weeks and complete rewrite of rendering layer
- React Flow provides better accessibility and DOM-based interactions
- Virtualization + LOD + spatial indexing achieves performance targets

**Future Consideration**: Evaluate WebGL for 10,000+ component use cases in 2026.

### AI Provider Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-provider support with OpenAI default
**Reasoning**:
- Existing AIConfigService supports multiple providers
- OpenAI GPT-4 best for text-to-diagram accuracy
- Anthropic Claude for complex architecture analysis
- Local models (Ollama) for privacy-sensitive deployments
- Cost optimization: cache results, batch requests

### Persistence Layer

**Decision**: Extend existing DesignSerializer + CanvasPersistence
**Reasoning**:
- Current system handles components, connections, layers
- Add frames, sections, AI metadata as extensions
- Maintain backward compatibility with migration functions
- Keep localStorage for client-side, add optional cloud sync later
