## Sta pada na pamet


Homebrew Cask (install via brew)
Yes—you can ship a Tauri (macOS) desktop app via Homebrew Cask so users can brew install --cask yourapp. You have two routes:

1) Easiest: your own tap (recommended to start)
	•	Create a GitHub repo named yourorg/homebrew-yourtap with a Casks/ folder. Homebrew will treat it as a tap.  ￼
	•	Generate a cask locally, then commit it to your tap: brew create --cask <download-url> --set-name yourapp (this opens a cask template).  ￼ ￼
	•	Keep the DMG/ZIP on GitHub Releases of your app repo. (Tauri builds DMG; macOS bundles are supported.)  ￼

Minimal cask example (put in Casks/yourapp.rb)

cask "yourapp" do
  version "1.2.3"
  sha256 "PUT_SHA256_OF_DMG"

  url "https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/releases/download/v#{version}/YourApp_#{version}.dmg",
      verified: "github.com/OWNER/REPO/"
  name "YourApp"
  desc "Short one-line description"
  homepage "https://github.com/OWNER/REPO"

  app "YourApp.app"
  auto_updates true

  # optional cleanup on uninstall
  zap trash: [
    "~/Library/Preferences/com.your.bundleid.plist",
    "~/Library/Application Support/YourApp",
    "~/Library/Logs/YourApp",
  ]

  livecheck do
    url :url
    strategy :github_latest
  end
end

Notes
	•	Casks are declarative; common stanzas: version, sha256, url, app, zap, livecheck.  ￼
	•	Choose a unique token (yourapp); if you worry about clashes, prefix with your org (e.g., yourorg-yourapp).  ￼
	•	Users install:

brew tap yourorg/yourtap
brew install --cask yourapp



2) Official Homebrew Cask (homebrew/cask)
	•	Submit a PR adding Casks/yourapp.rb to Homebrew/homebrew-cask. Popular, but stricter review; you’ll use brew create --cask and open a PR.  ￼
	•	See “Acceptable Casks”, “Cask Cookbook”, and “Adding Software to Homebrew” for rules and structure.  ￼

macOS signing & notarization (important)
	•	For a smooth brew install --cask, ship a signed & notarized DMG/App (Gatekeeper). Tauri docs cover codesign+notarize; Apple explains notarization requirements.  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼

Automate the whole thing (tag → build → notarize → release → update cask)
	1.	Build & Release via GitHub Actions using tauri-apps/tauri-action (multi-OS, uploads to Release).  ￼
	2.	Update your tap automatically after each tag:
	•	Compute the DMG SHA256 in CI.
	•	Commit a version bump to homebrew-yourtap (or open a PR) updating version and sha256.
Tools like GoReleaser can generate/publish a cask to your tap automatically after a release.  ￼

Quick checklist for your Tauri app → cask
	•	✅ Tauri builds notarized .dmg on macOS CI.  ￼
	•	✅ GitHub Release contains YourApp_<version>.dmg.
	•	✅ Cask in homebrew-yourtap/Casks/yourapp.rb points to that URL and has correct sha256.
	•	✅ (Optional) auto_updates true if you use the Tauri updater internally.
	•	✅ (Optional) livecheck to pick up new tags automatically.

If you share your repo/tag pattern (e.g., vX.Y.Z) and bundle ID, I can draft a ready-to-drop CI job that bumps the cask in your tap whenever you publish a new GitHub Release.

Mac App Store (optional later)
	•	Requires App Store provisioning, sandboxing, and stricter entitlements.
	•	Use fastlane (deliver, notarize, pilot) for CI to App Store Connect.
	•	Best when you want in-app purchases, subscriptions, or broader audience.

    Yes—your Tauri (Rust) desktop app can ship on the Mac App Store. Here’s the clean path that works and what changes vs. outside-store (brew/GitHub) distribution.

What’s different for the Mac App Store
	•	Sandboxing is mandatory → enable the App Sandbox entitlement and only request the capabilities you truly need (files, network, hardware, etc.).  ￼
	•	App Store signing/provisioning → sign with your Apple Distribution certificate + Mac App Store provisioning profile (distinct from Developer ID used for direct distribution). Tauri’s docs cover the App Store flow.  ￼
	•	Notarization: required for apps distributed outside the store; App Store submissions go through Apple review instead. (Notarization is still relevant for non-MAS builds.)  ￼

Tauri-side setup (high level)
	1.	Entitlements & sandbox
In src-tauri/tauri.conf.json (or TOML), declare the entitlements you need (App Sandbox on; minimal extras). Apple’s entitlement reference is your checklist.  ￼
	2.	Bundle identifiers & metadata
Ensure a stable bundle.identifier, category, versioning—Tauri’s macOS bundle guide shows the fields.  ￼
	3.	Signing for MAS
Configure signing to use your Apple Distribution certificate + Mac App Store profile when building the MAS target. Tauri’s distribution/signing docs outline the macOS pieces.  ￼

CI/CD with Fastlane (recommended)

Use fastlane to automate App Store Connect uploads (no Xcode Transporter clicks):
	•	deliver uploads your macOS app (typically as a .pkg) and manages metadata/screenshots.  ￼
	•	Authenticate with an App Store Connect API key (less 2FA hassle in CI).  ￼ ￼

Minimal fastlane/Fastfile (sketch):

default_platform(:mac)

platform :mac do
  desc "Build (MAS) & upload to App Store Connect"
  lane :release do
    # 1) Build your MAS-signed binary (invoke your Tauri build script/Makefile)
    sh "make mas_build"   # ensure this produces a signed .app and .pkg

    # 2) Upload metadata + pkg to App Store Connect
    deliver(
      submit_for_review: false,        # or true to auto-submit
      skip_screenshots: true,
      skip_metadata: false,
      pkg: "dist/YourApp-macOS.pkg"    # your MAS package
    )
  end
end

Fastlane’s deliver action docs cover flags for metadata, phased release, auto-submit, etc.  ￼

Review checklist (MAS)
	•	Sandbox passes with only necessary entitlements.  ￼
	•	No private APIs, complies with macOS App Review rules (data use, permissions prompts).
	•	App Store assets prepared (icon, screenshots, description).
	•	App Store Connect: create the app record, bundle ID, pricing, and upload via deliver → submit for review. Apple’s App Store Connect help walks through the submission states.  ￼

Reality check (Tauri + MAS)

Tauri explicitly supports App Store distribution, and devs have shipped Tauri apps to the Mac App Store—so this path is validated in the wild.  ￼ ￼

⸻

If you want, I can draft:
	•	the entitlements plist (with only the capabilities your app needs),
	•	a tiny Makefile/script that builds a MAS-signed .pkg from your Tauri output,
	•	and a Fastlane lane wired to your bundle ID + versioning.
