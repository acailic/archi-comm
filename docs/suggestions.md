ere are high‑leverage, well‑maintained OSS libraries that fit your stack and can save you time. I’ve included where they’d plug into this repo so adoption is straightforward.

Canvas & Graph

elkjs: Auto‑layout nodes and orthogonal edge routes for complex diagrams. Use to compute positions before setting nodes in src/features/canvas/components/ReactFlowCanvas.tsx:140.
dagre: Lightweight alternative for layered auto‑layout if you want simpler positioning than ELK. Also runs in the same spot as elkjs.
perfect-arrows: Nicer, collision‑aware arrow curves and offsets. Replace the bezier math in src/features/canvas/utils/connection-paths.ts:41 to get cleaner connectors.
rbush or flatbush: Fast spatial index for hit‑testing and viewport culling. Wrap your component bounds in an index to accelerate checks in src/shared/canvasUtils.ts:34 and annotation hit‑tests in src/lib/canvas/CanvasAnnotations.ts:47.
@use-gesture/react: Robust pointer gestures (drag, pinch, wheel) if you want refined interactions on overlays (e.g., panning/zooming src/components/CanvasAnnotationOverlay.tsx:33) independent of React Flow.
State & Undo

zustand + middleware (persist, subscribeWithSelector) + immer: Simple global store for components/connections with minimal re‑renders; immer simplifies immutable updates. Can centralize canvas state and time‑travel. Start near src/components/DesignCanvas.tsx:26 and replace the scatter of useState with a store.
zundo (for zustand): Drop‑in undo/redo history with partial snapshots; can replace src/hooks/useUndoRedo.ts:12.
Persistence & Tauri

Dexie or localforage: IndexedDB wrapper for web fallback persistence beyond localStorage (larger designs, async, throttled writes). Use in src/hooks/useAutoSave.ts or where you call localStorage in src/components/DesignCanvas.tsx:138.
tauri-specta: Generate TypeScript bindings for your Rust Tauri commands and data types to keep frontend/backend types in sync. Your Rust types live in src-tauri/src/main.rs:120; specta will emit TS that can replace duplicated shapes in src/shared/contracts.ts.
tauri-plugin-sql (alternative to custom sqlx commands): If you prefer issuing SQL from the frontend, this plugin saves boilerplate. Your current approach with sqlx in Rust is fine; this is a convenience option.
Search & UX

fuse.js or match-sorter: Add fuzzy ranking to your Command Palette. Slot into the filtering in src/components/CommandPalette.tsx to improve result quality.
nanoid: Collision‑resistant IDs instead of Date.now()/Math.random(). Use in src/lib/utils.ts:20 and places generating IDs like src/components/DesignCanvas.tsx:64.
Build & Dev

vite-plugin-svgr: Import SVGs as React components (props, styling) instead of URL modules. Add to vite.config.ts and replace \*.svg usages where helpful.
why-did-you-render: Dev‑only tool to spot avoidable re‑renders in complex canvases. Initialize in src/main.tsx:172 for development builds.
Testing & Quality

@axe-core/playwright: Accessibility checks inside your existing Playwright E2E suite. Add to playwright.config.ts usage and test flows in e2e/.
msw: Mock Tauri/web API calls during tests to stabilize test behavior. Use in src/test/setup-test.ts.
Quick add commands (pick what you need):

npm i elkjs perfect-arrows rbush nanoid fuse.js
npm i zustand immer zundo localforage
npm i -D vite-plugin-svgr @axe-core/playwright why-did-you-render
If you want, I can prototype one integration (e.g., ELK auto‑layout in ReactFlowCanvas or a zustand store for the canvas) so you can see it wired end‑to‑end. Which area should we prioritize first?

Implemented the requested E2E robustness and integration updates.
Highlights below.

Canvas Verification & Labeling

- Hardened verification in e2e/utils/test-data-manager.ts: - verifyDesignOnCanvas now matches node labels case-insensitively
  and accepts either component.name or a humanized display from type. - After each drop, applyDesignToCanvas selects the dropped node
  and, if component.name is provided, sets the label via the Properties
  panel input (Enter component label...).
- Updated industry tests to use case-insensitive assertions to avoid
  brittle casing mismatches: - e2e/industry-specific-tests.spec.ts now uses regex with /i for
  node text assertions.

Reliability & Retry on Drag

- Wrapped each drag in TestUtils.retryOperation with short delays (and
  checks node count increases).
- Added warnings for failed label set attempts for better debugging.
- Added TestUtils.zoomOut(page, steps) and used it for large designs
  (>= 200 nodes) to improve drop reliability.
- Added TestUtils.ensurePointClickable helper to hover/scroll into view
  when needed (available for future use).

Known Types DRY

- validateFixtureIntegrity() now sources types from a single, app-
  level contract: - Pulls keys from componentIconMap (centralized palette mapping in
  rabbitmq.

Template Registry Integration

- Integrated TemplateRegistry to avoid drift and prefer app-level
  templates: - Added loadTemplatesFromRegistry() in TestDataManager and called
  it in the constructor. - Converts app DesignData into E2E-friendly fixture format via
  TestUtils.convertAppTemplateToE2E. - Registers fixtures with keys like industry-ecommerce,
  scalability-microservices, etc., overriding programmatic fixtures where
  available.
- Left programmatic generators for benchmarks and other usage as
  requested.

Scalability Tests Fix

- Fixed incorrect broker assertions: - e2e/scalability-patterns.spec.ts now verifies canvas-level edges
  (.react-flow\_\_edge) after applying the microservices fixture. - Also made node label checks case-insensitive for other
  scalability tests.

Files Changed

- e2e/utils/test-data-manager.ts - Imports templateRegistry, componentIconMap. - ComponentData.name is optional. - loadTemplatesFromRegistry() added and invoked. - validateFixtureIntegrity() sources from componentIconMap, plus
  stopgap entries. - applyDesignToCanvas() uses retry, sets labels if provided, zooms
  out on large designs. - verifyDesignOnCanvas() uses case-insensitive matching and tries
  both label and humanized type. - Added TestUtils.zoomOut, TestUtils.ensurePointClickable,
  TestUtils.convertAppTemplateToE2E.
- e2e/industry-specific-tests.spec.ts - Replaced exact hasText matches with case-insensitive regex for
  robustness.
- e2e/scalability-patterns.spec.ts
  - Switched incorrect palette assertion to canvas edges.
  - Made label assertions case-insensitive in related tests.

Notes / Next Steps

- This keeps existing programmatic fixtures for benchmarks but favors
  the app’s TemplateRegistry for parity.
- If desired, I can extend the same case-insensitive updates
  to other specs that still assert exact strings (e.g., legacy-
  integration.spec.ts, canvas.spec.ts).
- If benchmark reliability still struggles, we can add an import-based
  path (using the app’s import feature) for benchmark templates.

▌think how to make drawing and system design part more interesting for
▌people to use and learn more about system design in interesting way, a
▌big of fun as well

> Here are focused, high‑leverage ideas to make drawing and system design
> more engaging, educational, and fun.

Engagement Loops

- Scenario cards: Pick a real-world brief (launch day surge, GDPR
  rollout, multi-region HA) with clear success metrics.
- Design → Simulate → Feedback loop: After placing components, “Run” to
  see latency, cost, reliability, and bottlenecks.
- Progression paths: Beginner → intermediate → advanced tracks with
  unlockable patterns (CQRS, Sagas, Serverless).

Game Mechanics

- Objectives and constraints: “Handle 50k RPS under $X/day” or “99.95%
  SLO with single AZ outage”.
- Score engine: Reward scalability, cost-efficiency, fault tolerance,
  maintainability; penalize anti-patterns (single DB bottleneck).
- Badges and streaks: Pattern Master (used CQRS correctly), Budget
  Ninja (cost under target), Resilience Guru (survived chaos).

Learning Mechanics

- Pattern micro-missions: 5–10 minute mini-challenges focused on one
  idea (idempotency, DLQ, backpressure, rate limiting).
- Hints with tiers: Nudge (high-level prompt) → Example (small design
  snippet) → Explanation (why it works).
- Built-in “Why” popovers: Each component shows when-to-use, tradeoffs,
  and common pitfalls.

Simulation & “Fun”

- Chaos mode: Toggle failures (AZ down, queue backlog, network
  partition). Watch edges animate retries, DLQs fill, autoscale kick in.
- Live metrics overlay: Edges show throughput/latency; nodes show CPU,
  memory, and queue depth with simple visual gauges.
- Budget/time slider: Tune traffic and budget, rerun simulation; see
  tradeoffs in real time.

Social & Collaboration

- Pair-design: Live cursors with comments; timed “design jam” rounds
  and handoff.
- Leaderboards: Per scenario (best latency under $X), weekly spotlight
  designs with short write-ups.
- Share & remix: Publish a design; others fork and submit improvements
  with diff and rationale.

Content & Storytelling

- Story mode: Chaptered narrative (startup → hypergrowth → compliance →
  multi-cloud) with saved state between chapters.
- Boss fights: Sudden traffic spikes or regulation changes force design
  pivots under a timer.
- Postmortem generator: After simulation, auto-create a brief with root
  causes, mitigations, and “next iteration”.

AI Assistance (opt‑in)

- Copilot: “Add an active-active multi-region data layer” → proposes a
  subgraph and explains tradeoffs.
- Critique: Highlights anti-patterns (e.g., unbounded fan-out) and
  suggests fixes with references.
- Code handoff: Generate Terraform/K8s skeletons or ADR drafts from
  the design.

UX Details That Delight

- Component “stickers” and themes: Fun but optional skins, celebrate
  milestones with subtle animations (confetti on first >99.9% SLO).
- Inline playgrounds: Right sidebar “What if?” knobs (replicas, read/
  write split) with instant sim feedback.
- Learning breadcrumbs: Show which concepts you practiced and what’s
  next to master a track.

Assessment & Feedback

- Rubrics per scenario: Functional fit, scalability, resilience, cost,
  complexity. Show how to improve each axis.
- Anti-pattern linter: Single region, no retries, hot shards, chatty
  microservices; one-click “show me a fix”.
- Before/after diffs: Visualize improvement after applying hints or
  AI suggestions.

Discovery & Retention

- Daily design puzzles: Tiny constraints (e.g., “minimize P99 latency
  under 200ms”) with 5-minute timebox.
- Weekly theme: “Event-driven week”, rotating content and badges; mini-
  series to build a larger final design.
- Seasonal challenges: Multi-round tournaments; finals judged by
  community votes plus rubric.

Rollout Plan (2 weeks MVP)

- Week 1: - Add Scenario Cards, Score Engine (simple latency/cost/fault
  tolerance heuristics), and Anti-pattern Linter. - Implement Simulate button with basic metrics overlay (static
  model; no complex runtime yet).
- Week 2:
  - Chaos Mode (prebaked failure scripts) + Live Metrics overlays.
  - Pattern Micro-missions (5 short challenges) with tiered hints.
  - Share/Remix flow and a simple leaderboard.

If you want, I can prioritize a concrete MVP spec (data model for
scenarios, scoring rules, chaos scripts) and wire the Simulate/Score/
Hint loop into the current canvas.
