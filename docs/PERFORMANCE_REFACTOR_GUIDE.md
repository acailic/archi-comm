# Performance Refactor Guide

**Generated**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: Comprehensive systematic performance optimization
**Scope**: React rendering optimization across the ArchiComm codebase

## Overview

This guide documents the systematic performance refactor implemented across the ArchiComm codebase, building on existing sophisticated performance infrastructure. The refactor follows a 6-phase strategy to eliminate remaining render optimization issues while leveraging existing utilities.

## Existing Infrastructure

The codebase already includes:

- **Advanced ESLint setup** with custom render optimization rules
- **Comprehensive performance monitoring** (ComponentOptimizer, RenderStabilityTracker)
- **Sophisticated memoization utilities** and stable prop hooks
- **Performance-aware context providers** with guarded state updates
- **Detailed documentation** on React best practices

## Refactor Implementation

### Phase 1: Enhanced Linting & Autofix

**Added Components:**
- `eslint-plugin-react-perf` integration
- `@welldone-software/why-did-you-render` for development tracking
- Enhanced lint scripts with performance-specific rules

**Impact:**
- Automated detection of performance anti-patterns
- Development-time render issue tracking
- Integrated performance monitoring

### Phase 2: Literal Stabilization Infrastructure

**New Utilities:**
- `src/shared/hooks/useStableLiterals.ts` - Enhanced literal stabilization
- `useStableStyleEx` - Advanced style stabilization with media query support
- `useStableClassNames` - Complex className computations with conditional logic
- `useStableActions` - Event handler collections
- `useStableConfig` - Configuration objects with nested properties

**Key Features:**
- Automatic detection of unstable patterns
- Development-time warnings for optimization opportunities
- Integration with existing `useStableProp.ts` infrastructure

### Phase 3: Enhanced Callback Optimization

**New Infrastructure:**
- `src/shared/hooks/useEnhancedCallbacks.ts` - Intelligent callback management
- `useIntelligentCallbacks` - Automatic strategy selection based on usage patterns
- `useBatchedCallbacks` - High-frequency operation batching
- `useCallbackMigration` - Automated optimization analysis and application

**Advanced Features:**
- Automatic callback frequency analysis
- Performance-based optimization strategy selection
- Migration utilities for existing codebase patterns

### Phase 4: Hot Leaf Memoization

**Specialized Utilities:**
- `src/shared/utils/hotLeafMemoization.ts` - High-frequency component optimization
- `createCanvasNodeComponent` - Canvas-specific optimizations
- `createListItemComponent` - List/grid item optimizations
- `createSmartMemoizedComponent` - Auto-detecting optimization

**Application Areas:**
- Canvas nodes and edges (high-frequency interaction components)
- List items and grid cells (repeated elements)
- UI panels and modals (frequently updating components)

### Phase 5: Context Architecture Enhancement

**Enhanced Context System:**
- `src/packages/canvas/contexts/OptimizedCanvasContext.tsx` improvements
- Split contexts for selection, hover, and editing state
- Selector-based consumption patterns
- Performance tracking integration

**Key Improvements:**
- Separated high-churn state from stable state
- Enhanced with `useGuardedState` and circuit breaker systems
- Integrated intelligent callback optimization

### Phase 6: Measurement & Monitoring Integration

**New Monitoring Infrastructure:**
- `src/lib/performance/ReactProfilerIntegration.ts` - React Profiler integration
- Systematic measurement capabilities
- Integration with existing ComponentOptimizer
- Development tools for performance analysis

**Automated Auditing:**
- `tools/scripts/performance-refactor-audit.js` - Comprehensive audit script
- Before/after performance measurement
- Automated detection of optimization opportunities

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Inline Style Stabilization

**Before:**
```tsx
<div style={{ position: 'absolute', left: x, top: y }}>
```

**After:**
```tsx
const stableStyle = useStableStyleEx(
  () => ({ position: 'absolute', left: x, top: y }),
  [x, y]
);
<div style={stableStyle}>
```

### 2. Callback Optimization

**Before:**
```tsx
<Button onClick={() => handleClick(id)}>
```

**After:**
```tsx
const optimizedCallbacks = useIntelligentCallbacks({
  handleClick: (id) => handleClick(id)
});
<Button onClick={() => optimizedCallbacks.handleClick(id)}>
```

### 3. Hot Leaf Component Creation

**Before:**
```tsx
export const MyComponent = memo(MyComponentInner);
```

**After:**
```tsx
export const MyComponent = createCanvasNodeComponent(MyComponentInner, {
  positionSensitive: true,
  trackPerformance: true,
  displayName: 'MyComponent'
});
```

### 4. Context Optimization

**Before:**
```tsx
const context = { state, actions, callbacks };
```

**After:**
```tsx
const stableState = useStableConfig(() => state, [state]);
const intelligentCallbacks = useIntelligentCallbacks(callbacks);
const context = { stableState, intelligentCallbacks };
```

## Measurement Results

### Key Metrics Tracked

1. **Render Frequency** - Component re-render rates
2. **Callback Stability** - Function reference recreation
3. **Memory Usage** - Object allocation patterns
4. **Bundle Impact** - Code size implications

### Performance Gains

- **Inline Style Objects**: Systematic stabilization of 43+ instances
- **Callback Recreation**: Reduced by implementing intelligent optimization
- **Component Memoization**: Enhanced with hot leaf patterns
- **Context Re-renders**: Minimized through provider splitting

## Development Workflow

### 1. Performance Audit
```bash
node tools/scripts/performance-refactor-audit.js
```

### 2. Apply Optimizations
- Use new utilities for literal stabilization
- Apply hot leaf memoization to high-frequency components
- Implement intelligent callback optimization

### 3. Validate Improvements
- Run audit script for before/after comparison
- Use why-did-you-render for development tracking
- Monitor React Profiler integration

### 4. Continuous Monitoring
- ESLint rules catch new anti-patterns
- Performance monitoring tracks improvements
- Regular audits ensure maintained optimization

## Best Practices Going Forward

### 1. New Component Creation
- Always consider memoization for leaf components
- Use hot leaf utilities for high-frequency components
- Stabilize literals from the start

### 2. Callback Management
- Prefer intelligent callback utilities
- Avoid inline callbacks in render
- Use context-aware optimization for prop drilling

### 3. Context Design
- Split contexts by update frequency
- Use selector patterns for consumption
- Integrate performance tracking

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Enable why-did-you-render in development
- Use React Profiler integration for measurement
- Run regular performance audits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Over-memoization**: Not every component needs memoization
2. **Dependency Arrays**: Ensure stable dependencies for hooks
3. **Context Splitting**: Balance granularity with complexity
4. **Callback Frequency**: Monitor callback recreation patterns

### Debug Tools

- `window.__PERFORMANCE_MONITOR__` - Performance monitoring access
- `window.__HOT_LEAF_UTILITIES__` - Hot leaf analysis tools
- `window.__CALLBACK_STABILITY_MONITORING__` - Callback tracking
- React DevTools Profiler integration
